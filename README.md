Discord 11 Glass is a modern glass-style betterdiscord theme based on [Discord11](https://github.com/zuzumi-f/Discord-11) by [Zuzumi](https://github.com/zuzumi-f).
## Background
Discord 11 Glass has several backgrounds included (solid color mode coming soon!).
To change background simply replace `--wallpaper-is: url(https://agentseed.org/ranbg?color=purple) !important;` with one of the following:
- `--wallpaper-is: url(https://agentseed.org/discord11-glass/backgrounds/?type=windowsdefault) !important;` For default windows 11 wallpapers
- `--wallpaper-is: url(https://agentseed.org/discord11-glass/backgrounds/?type=windowsstyle) !important;` For windows 11 inspired wallpapers
- `--wallpaper-is: url(https://agentseed.org/discord11-glass/backgrounds/?type=bloom) !important;` For different colors of default windows 11 bloom wallpaper
- `--wallpaper-is: url(https://agentseed.org/saphire3dx) !important;` For pictures of seals!
or if you'd simply like a different color you can replace the `?color=purple` part of the default with any of the following supported colors:
- `?color=blue` Blue
- `?color=red` Red
- `?color=green` Green
- `?color=purple` Purple
All of these opions give you a random image from a set on my server. If you'd like addional backgrounds added, open an issue.
